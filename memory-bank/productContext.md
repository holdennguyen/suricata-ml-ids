# Product Context: Suricata ML-IDS

## Problem Statement
Traditional signature-based IDS systems like Suricata excel at detecting known attack patterns but struggle with:
- Zero-day attacks and unknown threats
- Advanced persistent threats (APTs) using novel techniques
- Encrypted traffic analysis
- High false positive rates in complex network environments

## Solution Approach
Hybrid IDS combining:
1. **Signature Detection** (Suricata) for known threats
2. **Machine Learning** for anomaly detection and unknown threats
3. **Real-time Processing** for immediate threat response
4. **SIEM Integration** for comprehensive security monitoring
